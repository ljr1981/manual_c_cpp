# manual_c_cpp
Examples of manually wrapping C/C++ externals in Eiffel

## Purpose
The purpose of this example project (especially the `test` target) is to demonstrate successful hand-coded wrapping of either C API code directly or external DLLs.

## Heads Up!
This code was developed on MS Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2020 and Eiffel 19.11. If you are using any other OS (e.g. Linux, Mac) then the "test" code will not work.

## DLL Wrapping
Apparently, there is more than one way to wrap a DLL (MS Windows). The hand-wrapped code uses one method. There are others.
